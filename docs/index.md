# Supporting Climate Science and Meteorology

[climet.eu](https://climet.eu) is developing tools to support weather and climate modelling:

- [lab.climet.eu](https://lab.climet.eu): Online Laboratory for Climate Science and Meteorology, developed at [climet-eu/lab](https://github.com/climet-eu/lab)
- [compression.lab.climet.eu](https://compression.lab.climet.eu): Online Laboratory for Data Compression in Climate Science and Meteorology, developed at [climet-eu/compression-lab-notebooks](https://github.com/climet-eu/compression-lab-notebooks)

## Quickly Getting Started

- Open the latest version of the Online Laboratory for Climate Science and Meteorology, [lab.climet.eu](https://lab.climet.eu)
- Open the latest version of the Online Laboratory for Data Compression in Climate Science and Meteorology, [compression.lab.climet.eu](https://compression.lab.climet.eu)

<hr>

- Open an existing [git repository][open-a-git-repository-in-the-online-laboratory] in the Online Laboratory for Climate Science and Meteorology
- Open an existing [gist][open-a-gist-in-the-online-laboratory] in the Online Laboratory for Climate Science and Meteorology
- Open an existing [file URL][open-a-file-url-in-the-online-laboratory] in the Online Laboratory for Climate Science and Meteorology
